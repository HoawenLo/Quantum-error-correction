# Three qubit error correction code for bit flips

This section showcases the simple three qubit error correction code for bit flips.

There are two implementations, one with Pennylane and the other with Qiskit.

Jupyter notebooks are used to allow the code along with outputs to be seen on github.

# Brief overview of error correction code

TBD




Please see the detailed_notes directory for a more detailed analysis of the three qubit error correction code.
